**pcl_pcd2ply** somehow broken. I was tried of converting pcd to ply and fix the format. So deiced to just make one.  
This coverter based on **open3d**. If you're using old ROS1 i suggest to use conda python3 evn to install requirements.  

## Todo list
- [x] pcd->ply
- [ ] Multiple files select

UI for converting various point cloud file formats
(currently pcd -> ply)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
